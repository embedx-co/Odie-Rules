all earlier technical specs remain valid unless superseded here.

2 · Round Flow (replaces §5 in prior spec)
#	Phase	Key Actions	Timer
1	Prompt Reveal	Single Prompt card shown to everyone.	—
2	Planning	Pitchers prepare; Venture “pre-pitch” cards playable.	pitch_timer_sec
3	Pitching	Each pitcher presents. Venture “mid-pitch” cards playable. Investor listens.	presentation_timer_sec per player
4	Investor Selection	Investor secretly taps the pitch they back. Selection hidden until Phase 6.	30 s (configurable)
5	Peer Voting	All Pitchers + allowed Observers vote for one pitch (no self-vote). Investor does not vote.	30 s (configurable)
6	Reveal & Funding	UI reveals:	
 a. Investor’s chosen pitch			
 b. Vote counts per pitch	—		
7	Funding Calculation	Let I be the Investor, P the pitcher invested in, V_total the number of valid votes, V_match votes that went to P.	
 • Pitcher P gains the fixed Investment Amount (default $1 B; configurable).			
 • Investor I gains Profit = Investment Amount × (V_match / V_total).			
  Example: 20% of players voted for P ⇒ Investor gains $0.2 B.			
 • If V_total = 0 ⇒ Investor gains $0.	—		
8	Apply Venture Effects	Resolve Venture cards marked “post-pitch”.	—
9	Round End	Update leader-board; rotate Investor; check win conditions.	—

3 · Scoring / Win Condition Changes
Pitcher earnings now come only from Investor Investment plus Venture modifiers.

Investor earnings accumulate like any player’s funding and count toward the global win target.

First participant (pitcher or investor) to reach funding_target_billion wins, or highest funding after max_rounds.

4 · UI / UX Adjustments
Investor Badge: visually highlight the current Investor in lobby & in-round headers.

Secret Pick Modal: Investor sees list of pitcher avatars/titles; submission is hidden until Phase 6.

Voting Panel must exclude Investor automatically.

Funding Reveal Animation: show Pitcher gain, then Investor profit with percentage overlay.

Leaderboard should label Investor gains distinctly (e.g., green “Investor Profit”).

5 · Edge-Case Rules
Scenario	Resolution
Investor selects themselves (illegal)	Block UI; investor must choose another player.
Tie in votes for V_match?	Still counts; V_match is total votes on the invested pitch, regardless of tie elsewhere.
V_total = 0 (nobody voted)	Pitcher still gets full investment; Investor gains $0.
All non-investor players abstain or disconnect	Auto-skip round or re-deal, at host’s discretion.
